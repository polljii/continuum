# Technology Continuum
### Digital Asset Lifecycle Governance Framework Development
> Developed a comprehensive governance framework to oversee the
            complete lifecycle of digital assets across the organization. The
            framework evaluated existing tools, software, and applications, and
            provided clear criteria for determining whether they should be
            retired, replaced, updated, adopted, or newly deployed. This
            strategic approach enhanced decision-making, reduced redundancy, and
            improved technology alignment with business goals. The initiative
            helped streamline IT operations and ensured consistent, future-proof
            digital asset management.
